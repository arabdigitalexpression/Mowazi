# Mowazi: An Online Educational Platform

Mowazi is an online educational platform that dreams of having an impact on the education scene. Mowazi.org aspires to bring new formats to the traditional educational methodology by adding interactive and creative elements.

We believe one solution to the challenges facing the education sector is developing an online parallel world of educational material where learning is fun and accessible for everyone to participate in and benefit from.

## Description

*Mowazi*, which means parallel in Arabic, is an open-source user-generated online platform that offers diverse and expansive Arabic educational content. **Mowazi.org** can be accessed easily from any web browser whether on desktop or mobile anywhere in the world. Users simply create an account and enjoy easy navigation of material uploaded in the five different content types on the Mowazi website: articles, activities, workshops, games, and stories. The different types of content cover various topics and learning methods.

Users can create content where they can work on their own or with a group. Any type of content could be bookmarked while users are browsing to easily find it later. Knowing the hassle for educators to prepare their workshops/classes, we designed **Mowazi.org** to offer special tools for all types of educators and educational institutions to help prepare and organize their material.

Mowazi’s content is distinguished because it is open-source which means content is always dynamic. The platform is designed in a way to allow its different content to be shared with other users thus creating a space to discuss and receive feedback on education methods and activities.
